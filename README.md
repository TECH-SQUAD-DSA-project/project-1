## How to Play

3. Eat the food (`@`) to grow the snake and increase your score.
4. Avoid colliding with the walls or the snakeâ€™s body.
5. Press `X` anytime to exit the game.
6. After game over, choose `Y` to restart or `N` to exit.

## Compilation & Execution
To compile the game, use a C++ compiler (MinGW for Windows recommended):
```sh
 g++ -o snake_game snake_game.cpp -static-libgcc -static-libstdc++
```
Run the game using:
```sh
 ./snake_game
```

## Requirements
- Windows OS (due to `windows.h` dependency)
- C++ Compiler (e.g., MinGW, MSVC)

## Notes
